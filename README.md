# eDicer

Tool to investigate ``collisions'' between two transcriptomic 
datasets such as those generated by RNAi machinery.

## Overview

Inputs/params:

-    Dataset 1 (e.g. host transcriptome)

-    Dataset 2 (e.g. endosymbiont transcriptome)

-    %id Threshold (e.g. 95% or 100% as RNAi machinery doesn't require exact matches)

-    Collision Length (e.g. 23bp)


Outputs:

-   Collision mapping file (e.g. tsv with dataset 1 accession, dataset 2 accession, collision sequence)

-   Dataset 1 collision fasta (e.g. all collision sequences in 1)

-   Dataset 2 collision fasta (e.g. all collision ssequences in 2)



Execution:

- Collison length-merise Dataset 1 sequences in a reconstructable way

- Use vsearch to identify collisions between
